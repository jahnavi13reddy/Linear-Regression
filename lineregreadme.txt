Linear-Regression-
A machine learning project to show that a particular data set shows linear regression

note:
download the USAhousing.csv file prior.
Coding should be done in jupyter notebook line by line.
Points to Ponder
Steps In Machine Learning:
This project processes through the steps of machine learning.

Data Collection
Cleaning the data
Data Analysis
Data Visualisation
Algorithm Selection
Algorithm Training
Algorithm Testing
Output
Supervised Data:
Data is categorised Perfectly. Its is usually a set of labelled data

Unsupervised Data:
Its a set of unlabelled data. It is data driven.

CLASSICAL MACHINE LEARNING
Supervised:
Classification
Regression
Unsupervised
Dimension Reduction(generalisation)
Clustering
Association
Reason behind selecting the USA housing Data set is because of the accuracy of values.

Comments are added in the code part which illustrates the need of every line.
